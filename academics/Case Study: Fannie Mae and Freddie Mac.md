# Case Study: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

### What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?

Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are **Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)**. They are large, private shareholder-owned corporations that were established by the U.S. government. In September 2008, during the subprime mortgage crisis, they were placed into conservatorship, meaning they were put under the control of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

### What was the purposes of establishing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?

The GSEs were historically established to support the U.S. housing market.

* **Fannie Mae** was created first in 1938 as part of the New Deal, following the Great Depression. Its purpose was to "make mortgages more available to low-income families" and "facilitate liquidity within the mortgage market".
* **Freddie Mac** was created later, in 1970. Its purpose was "to introduce competition to Fannie Mae and, thus, create a stronger and more efficient secondary mortgage market".

Together, they played a key role in developing a mortgage market that allowed many US citizens, especially those with lower incomes, to achieve homeownership.

### How did Fannie Mae (and Freddie Mac) act as a middleman?

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acted as powerful middlemen by connecting local banks with global investors, which increased the amount of money available for mortgages and allowed the GSEs to make large profits.

Here is the process:
1.  **Buying Mortgages:** The GSEs would buy mortgages from banks and other approved lenders.
2.  **Providing Liquidity:** This purchase provided the banks with "fresh money to make even more new loans". This action "increas[ed] the pool of homeowners".
3.  **Repackaging (Securitization):** They would then pool these mortgages together to create **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**.
4.  **Selling Securities:** They sold these MBS to investors.
5.  **Making Profits:** The GSEs made profits by charging fees for this service. For a fee, they **guaranteed** to investors the "timely payment of interest and principal" on the MBS, even if the original borrower defaulted. As they began handling riskier loans, they charged higher fees, believing the extra income would offset any future losses.

### What was the consequence of easing credit requirements?

The easing of credit requirements, which began in the late 1990s due to political pressure to expand homeownership, had disastrous consequences.

* It led to **riskier mortgages** being issued to subprime borrowers.
* Fannie and Freddie then issued **riskier MBSs** backed by these questionable loans.
* When the housing market stalled, many of these borrowers, particularly those with adjustable-rate mortgages, were **unable to pay**.
* This caused a **steep rise in home foreclosures**, which in turn caused house prices to fall.
* The fall in house prices led to **mounting losses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac**, which had guaranteed these mortgages.
* By August 2008, their shares had plummeted over 90%. Their failure endangered the entire U.S. financial system, forcing the government to take control in the 2008 bailout.

### What is the model risk in this case study?

The **model risk** was the failure of the GSEs' mathematical formulas and computer systems to accurately analyze the new, complex loans they were buying.

Fannie Mae had built a vast network of computer programs and models to analyze transactions and rank borrowers by their risk profile. However, these models were designed for "plain vanilla loans".

When the GSEs started buying complex subprime products (which layered risks like teaser rates, interest-only payments, and low-documentation requirements), the models could not correctly identify the "unsafe bets". A former director explained the model risk perfectly: "This system was designed for plain vanilla loans, and we were trying to push chocolate sundaes through the gears".
