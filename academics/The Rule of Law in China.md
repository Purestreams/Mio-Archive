- **Date:** December 2022

## 1. Introduction

Legalism, a historical concept in China, advocates for governing the nation through law and imposing severe punishments on criminals to uphold governmental authority. The Qin Dynasty marked a significant shift in China, with Legalists supplanting Confucians and establishing the Qin system. Legalism persisted for over 2,000 years until the late Qing Dynasty, when Western culture brought it to an end. In the last century, China was under the influence of Mao Zedong Thought, which rejected traditional Chinese thought, leading to chaos and lawlessness during the Cultural Revolution. This rejection of tradition led to a breakdown of moral concepts, leaving many without guidance. Following the Cultural Revolution, China initiated reforms to its legal system, as there was effectively no law in China prior to the 1980s.

Since then, numerous laws, particularly economic and administrative laws, have been enacted. China gradually recovered from the Cultural Revolution, and the status of law was progressively restored through economic reform. Although the current legal system in China is more comprehensive compared to the last century, many problems persist. This essay analyzes the rule of law in mainland China, focusing on developments over the past few decades and current shortcomings.

## 2. Progress of Rule of Law in China

The rule of law emphasizes governance by law rather than by individuals. It concerns the social administration system and public activities, with the protection of human rights and freedoms as the cornerstone of legislation, strict enforcement of the law as the state's nerve center, and the control of power as the key (Chen, 2016). The rule of law is closely related to constitutional governance, emphasizing the regulation and limitation of governmental power and universal adherence to the law.

### 2.1 Judicial System Reform

In 2013, a judicial reform was implemented to prevent party officials from intervening in judicial cases. The Supreme People's Court announced the Opinions on Establishing a Mechanism for Preventing Wrongful Criminal Cases, stipulating that party officials would not intervene in legal cases, except in areas such as diplomacy and national security.

Previously, party policies often superseded national laws in trials, allowing external party organs to interfere with court proceedings (Tian, 2016). The concept of "independent trials, obeying only the law" was once a forbidden topic. Obedience to party leadership, especially during the anti-right-wing period and Cultural Revolution, was the judicial system's primary responsibility. Although the system of approving cases by the Party Committee was abolished during the reform and opening up, the practice of consulting the Party Committee on cases persisted, effectively maintaining the Party Committee's interference in judicial cases.

### 2.2 Police System Reform

The custody and repatriation system was abolished in 2003 following a widely publicized case of human rights violation. A young university graduate, identified as a vagrant by the Guangzhou government, was beaten to death by shelter staff during detention. This incident sparked significant debate, leading to the abolition of the system, which was widely seen as flawed and unconstitutional.

#### 2.2.1 Abolishment of Re-education Through Labour

In 2014, the "Re-education through Labour" system was abolished, ending over 60 years of this practice in China. Established during the anti-rightist movement in the 1950s, it was ostensibly used for theft, fraud, prostitution, drug abuse, disruption of public order, fighting, and assault. However, many petitioners, dissidents, and pro-democracy activists were illegally sent there (Zou, 2006).

Re-education through labour was heavily criticized for being a form of punishment without trial. The system allowed for arbitrary detention without trial for extended periods, making it comparable to sentencing and drawing increased public criticism.

In 2011, a village official was accused by the Chongqing government of publishing over 100 pieces of "negative information" online (Wong, 2013). He was arrested, charged with "inciting subversion of state power," and sentenced to two years of labour re-education without a trial, representing a serious human rights violation. Some dissidents, petitioners, and human rights defenders were sent to re-education through labour camps without due process, violating the International Declaration of Human Rights.

#### 2.2.2 Abolishment of Custody and Education

Sex workers in China were often held in custody and education centers, where they faced institutional abuse and exploitation. Custodial education was seen more as a money-making venture than a means of rehabilitation (Tsang, 2020).

Custody and Education, unlike jail, was intended to provide a setting where inmates could gain useful life skills and education. Offenders accused of sex-work-related offenses were punished with custody education, potentially facing 6 months to 2 years of imprisonment (Human Right Watch, as cited in Tsang, 2020). Prisoners' procedural rights were often violated, much like in-custodial schooling.

In 2020, Premier Li Keqiang announced the "Decision of the State Council on Amending and Abolishing Some Administrative Regulations," abolishing 10 administrative regulations, including the "Measures for Custody and Education of Prostitutes and Clients." However, sex workers in China can still be arrested under the Law on Punishment of Public Security Management for up to 14 days, indicating that there is still a long way to go for legal reform in China toward the management of prostitution issues.

## 3. Problems in Current China

There are numerous aspects to consider; this essay primarily focuses on the inadequate protection of fundamental human rights. China’s human rights situation is controversial and has received significant international attention (Human Rights Watch, 2019).

### 3.1 Insufficient Protection to the Lawyers’ Basic Right

In 2015, Chinese public security authorities arrested, summoned, and criminally detained hundreds of lawyers, civil rights activists, petitioners, and their relatives in as many as 23 provinces during the "709 Crackdown" (China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, 2016). Many of these individuals remain unaccounted for. Most of the lawyers were accused of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” with sentences ranging from 1 to 4 years in jail. "Picking quarrels and provoking trouble” is a notorious catch-all charge in China, often used in the absence of concrete evidence.

Zhou Shifeng, a major target of the “709 Crackdown," is a well-known lawyer in China. In 2008, he represented victims of poisonous milk powder in a lawsuit against Sanlu Group. He frequently aided vulnerable groups, especially in cases against the government. In 2015, he was kidnapped by three men with his head covered in a hotel room, and his office was searched by the police.

The "709 Crackdown" was triggered by an incident in Heilongjiang, where a petitioner was shot to death during an altercation with the police. Lawyers submitted a complaint and provided free legal aid to the victims and detained protesters but were subjected to torture by the Heilongjiang police. Subsequently, 660 lawyers jointly requested a government investigation into the violation of lawyers’ rights and interests in Heilongjiang. The government then shifted from precaution to oppression of civil forces led by lawyers, resulting in the incident.

#### 3.1.1 Illegal Analysis of “709 Crackdown”

In this case, courts, public security authorities, judicial authorities, and administrative authorities engaged in many illegal and immoral acts.

One of the illegal acts is the abuse of crimes that endangers state security. As the lawyers were usually giving aid to cases against the government, 25 lawyers were charged with the crime of endangering state security. The lawyers had not supplied any false information or disseminated speech detrimental to state power, so this is an abuse. The actions of the human rights lawyers caused no harm but provided benefits to the public, so they should not constitute a crime.

Secondly, the public trial by state-owned news media before the actual trial is a serious illegal act. This is an abuse of the public media. People's Daily (a Chinese state-owned media outlet) published an article about the "inside story of human rights lawyers. “The report alleged rumors about lawyers, which criticized the lawyers’ characteristics and authorities without addressing the arguments and stated they disturbed “public social order."

Thirdly, the judicial administrative authority kept interfering with defense lawyers’ representation in specific cases and forcing lawyers out of cases. Lawyers are being forcibly summoned by local police and harassed in their homes. Even worse, lawyers were forcibly taken out by local police and prohibited from representation. Defense lawyers in human rights cases were warned not to show case information and interrogated by the local judicial bureau.

#### 3.1.2 Impact on Lawyers and Civil Society

This had a chilling effect on the Chinese people. This made people reluctant to exercise their legal right to supervise and give advice to the government. The government's control of the public sphere continues to make Chinese civil society more monotonous. Such an atmosphere makes the Chinese people aware of what they can and cannot do, which has a negative effect on Chinese legal equality.

### 3.2 Abuse of Quota in Administrative Cases

The "quota system" is a common management model used by Chinese government agencies, which requires each department, place, and police officer to complete a predetermined number of cases and fines within a certain period (Lubman, 2022). When indicators become the sole criterion for measuring the work of government officials, it is bound to easily lead to abuse and distortion of power. To complete the target of solving cases, the police can catch retarded farmers as car thieves; to complete the target of catching drug addicts, the police will not hesitate to catch innocent citizens to fill the numbers; to complete the hard target of "solving murder cases," the police can do whatever it takes to extract confessions through torture (Lubman, 2022).

#### 3.2.1 Example of Abuse of Quota

For example, on June 25th, 2022, China's public security authority began to implement the "100-day campaign." The meeting stressed the need to crack down on prominent illegal crimes, vigorously rectify social security problems, resolutely maintain social stability and protect people's peace, and take practical action to meet the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. A total of more than 640,000 criminal cases were cracked, and more than 1.43 million criminal suspects were arrested during the campaign. This kind of practice belongs to "movement-style law enforcement," lacks a legal basis, is prone to excessive arrests, and is likely to include legitimate innocent citizens (Cohen & Yin, 2022).

Although it may help maintain social stability in China, this campaign-like movement is an abuse of administrative power. These campaign-like movements always created many cases of injustice (Cohen & Yin, 2022). On August 15, 2022, during the campaign, a video showed a woman in Suzhou being taken away by police for wearing a kimono. The woman was eventually arrested by the police on charges of picking quarrels and provoking trouble. The public questioned the issue. The kimono is not a Japanese military uniform, and there is no legal reason it should be banned.

In 2020, Zhang Yuhuan, a man from Nanchang, Jiangxi, was acquitted after 27 years in prison, reflecting the reform ​of China's judicial system and the​ issue of official governance (Xue, 2021). The police and officials responsible for his case were arrested in 2019 on suspicion of serious violations of discipline, allowing the farmer's grievances to be redressed. After his release from prison, he said he suffered six days and six nights of torture to extract a confession, during which he was bitten by two wolf dogs.

Although the verdict in the “Zhang Yuhuan case” reflects the progress of judicial trials and the justice of the judicial process in China, it also reflects the serious contradiction between the rule of man and the rule of law in the Chinese judicial system (Xue, 2021). One of the important reasons for these unjust cases is that the case officer handling the case was subjected to excessive pressure to solve the case rate assessment, so that extreme measures were taken to speed up the conclusion of the case at the expense of creating this unjust case. Although the Supreme People's Procuratorate ​of China stated that​ there should not be index-based case handling, it is still common in China because China’s judicial system is not completely independent. Government officials can still interfere with judicial cases.

## 4. Future Ways of Development of Rule of Law in China

One way to advance the rule of law in China is to foster solidarity and mutual trust in civil society. Recently, civil society groups such as journalists, lawyers, feminists, labor activists, and ethnic minorities have used the Internet to express themselves. If this solidarity is maintained, they can monitor the authorities to promote more equitable justice under public supervision.

Public anger with the government in 2022 due to the zero-COVID policy provided an opportunity to raise civil awareness among Chinese citizens. Protests against the COVID policy called on the Chinese people to wake up and address various unreasonable phenomena, attracting international attention. These nationwide protests were rare and were regarded as the largest nationwide assembly and demonstration movement in 30 years.

Furthermore, long-term international attention and support are critical for the development of the rule of law in China. For example, China's entry into the World Trade Organization addressed issues of administrative transparency and intellectual property protection. Despite the Chinese government's rejection of universal values and basic human rights, citing the "Chinese national situation," "the China model,” and the unsuitability of “Western values in China," international organizations like the UN and the news media continue to provide support and attention to the poor supervision toward power and insufficient implantation of the rule of law.

## 5. Summary

In comparison to the 1970s, China has progressed from lawlessness to a generally comprehensive legal system, but the judicial, administrative, and prosecutorial systems remain plagued by issues. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” The development of the rule of law in China remains a long road, requiring the participation of both the general public and the government. In China, there is still serious violence against human rights, which contradicts popular belief.

A country with a constitution may not be a constitutionalist country. A country with laws may not be a country with the rule of law. In ancient China, the emperor had the biggest power. The law is a privilege law instead of a civil law. The rule of law and the rule of man cannot be combined. Everyone should be treated equally under the law; if the law is ruled by man, it implies that man is above the law, which violates the law's independence. The Chinese people are fundamentally united in their desire to build democracy and establish the rule of law. The hardest part of this journey is over, and the next stage requires cooperation from all of us.
